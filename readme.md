🐀 Overview

This is a satirical project exploring the existential dread of developers in the age of AI. Instead of building yet another Todo App™, I decided to create something more… honest.

When you run the program, it simply reveals the truth:

we're doomed


Minimal. Direct. Relatable.

💡 Inspiration

Every dev has a Todo App.
Every dev has a Calculator.
But only the truly broken ones have existential.exe.

This project is proof that:

Creativity > boilerplate projects

Humor is part of engineering

GPT can write code… but can GPT cope with the void?

🚀 Future Improvements

Add AI-generated motivational quotes to soften the doom

Create a Flask API endpoint: /doom → returns JSON { "message": "we're doomed" }

Dockerize doom 🐳

⚠️ Disclaimer

This README was partly written by GPT.
So if AI really can replace us…
at least it helped me roast myself first.
